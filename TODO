#### CRITICAL BUGS ####

flush object queues after kill
set queues before running All (else some objects will start to broadcast to non queue-ready objects => WRONG )
containers cannot be filled anymore after being loaded from sws file
History: cannot click/move objects while running (because of queues )


### OPTIMIZATIONS ###

improve synapp datastreams xfer rates

## IMPORTANT ##

ask for save what to do with unsaved docs before closing
Add inputs and outputs orientation ( mux/demux will have 2 pos only, monitor, comment and container will have none) (40% done)
Add loop on itself feature for concerned building blocks
Implement Wake on input feature (70% done)
Implement synjector BB
Finish to implement synfilter component
Implement saving and loading ( 95% done )
Implement clipboard (60 % done)
Implement undu/redo (70 % done)
Implement display buffer
Implement building blocks z-index
add events for progress and status bars
